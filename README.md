Stack Implementation in Java
Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a stack, a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. In a stack, the most recently added element is the first one to be removed. Stacks are commonly used in programming for function calls, expression evaluation, undo operations, and more.

Features

Push elements onto the stack.

Pop elements from the stack.

Peek to view the top element.

Display all stack elements.

Dynamic handling of stack operations with error checks for underflow.

How to Use

Compile and run the Java program.

Choose operations from the menu: push, pop, peek, display.

Enter integer values as prompted.

Requirements

Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.

No external libraries required.

Notes

Stack operations are implemented using arrays or linked lists.

Proper error messages are shown for invalid operations, such as popping from an empty stack.
